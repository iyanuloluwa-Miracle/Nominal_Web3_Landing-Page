# Nuxt Minimal Starter ⚠️ **ABANDONED PROJECT** ⚠️

> **Status**: This project has been abandoned due to overwhelming complexity. The developer has retreated to a safe distance and is now pursuing simpler endeavors like counting grains of sand or teaching cats to use keyboards.

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more (though we clearly didn't learn enough 😅).

## 🚨 Important Notice

This project was abandoned faster than a shopping cart with a wobbly wheel. Here's what happened:

- ✅ Started with enthusiasm and coffee
- ✅ Read some documentation
- ✅ Wrote some code
- ❌ Encountered "minor" complexity issues
- ❌ Complexity issues evolved into hydra-like monsters
- ❌ Developer sanity.exe stopped working
- ❌ Project declared legally dead

## 💀 Cause of Death: **Complexity Overload**

This project succumbed to what we call "Feature Creep Syndrome" combined with "Analysis Paralysis Disorder." Symptoms included:
- Infinite dependency loops
- Configuration files that achieved sentience
- CSS that refused to center things
- JavaScript that worked on Tuesdays only

## 🏃‍♂️ What We Learned

1. Sometimes the simplest solution is to walk away
2. Not every battle needs to be fought
3. There's no shame in strategic retreating
4. Coffee consumption has natural limits (we found them)

## Setup (For the Brave/Foolish)

If you dare to resurrect this digital zombie, make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm (prepare for disappointment)
npm install

# pnpm (pain & misery)
pnpm install

# yarn (yet another really nightmare)
yarn install

# bun (better u never)
bun install
```

## Development Server (Abandon Hope)

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000` (may actually start on a different dimension):

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production (Theoretical)

Build the application for production (results may vary dramatically):

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build (if the stars align correctly):

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```

## 📚 Documentation

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information on how to deploy something that actually works.

## 🤝 Contributing

We're not accepting contributions because:
1. There's nothing left to contribute to
2. We don't want to inflict this pain on others
3. Our GitHub issues would just be people crying

## 📄 License

This project is licensed under the "Do Whatever You Want But Don't Blame Us" license.

## 🙏 In Memory Of

This README is dedicated to:
- All the lost hours of sleep
- The keyboard that sacrificed several keys to rage-typing
- Our original timeline and budget
- The developer's will to live (temporarily misplaced)

*"In the end, we realized that some battles are not worth fighting, and some code is not worth writing. This is one of those times."*

**Alternative Projects**: We recommend gardening, bird watching, or learning to juggle flaming torches. All are considerably less complex than whatever this was supposed to become.
